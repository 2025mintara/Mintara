## Platform Overview

### 1. No-Code Token Builder

Create custom ERC-20 tokens on Base easily.
AI automatically audits contracts, prevents vulnerabilities, and optimizes gas efficiency before deployment.

### 2. AI Audit & Optimization

Mintara's audit engine performs real-time code scanning, detects risks, and assigns each contract a security rating before launch.

### 3. AI NFT Builder (Now Live 🚀)

An integrated system to generate and mint AI-created NFTs, including:

- AI-generated artwork
- Auto-generated metadata
- On-chain minting and BaseScan verification
- Batch mint support and rarity logic

### 4. IVO Launchpad

The Intelligent Verified Offering (IVO) module enables secure token presales and fundraising with escrow protection.
Investor funds remain locked until audit conditions are met — ensuring full transparency and safety.

### 5. Distributed AI Verification

Mintara uses distributed AI validators to confirm contract safety and performance.
This ensures independent, trustless verification of deployed assets.

## Revenue Model & Burn Mechanism

Mintara generates revenue from:

- Token deployment & AI audit fees
- NFT minting services
- IVO Launchpad presale fees
- Premium user subscriptions

🔥 **35% of all platform revenue will be used to buy back and burn $MINTA tokens directly on-chain.**  
This deflationary system continuously reduces circulating supply and increases token scarcity over time.

The remaining 65% of revenue supports ongoing development, infrastructure, and community rewards.
