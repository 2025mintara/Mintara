# Mintara Whitepaper

## Executive Summary

Mintara is an AI-powered, no-code token and NFT creation platform built exclusively on the Base Network.

The platform empowers users to create and deploy fully secure ERC-20 tokens and AI-generated NFTs within minutes — without requiring any coding skills.

**$MINTA** is the native utility token that fuels all ecosystem operations, including AI audits, deployment fees, staking, governance, and premium access.

**Mission:** To simplify tokenization and NFT creation on Base — making it secure, accessible, and intelligent.

**Vision:** To build the foundation for AI-driven decentralized creation and automation across the Web3 ecosystem.

## Core Values

### Accessibility
Token and NFT creation should be available to everyone.

### Security
Every contract undergoes a complete AI audit prior to deployment.

### Transparency
All processes are verifiable and traceable on-chain.

### Sustainability
35% of all platform revenue is allocated to $MINTA buyback and burn.

### Autonomy
Fully decentralized, self-governed deployments on the Base Network.

## Platform Overview

### 1. No-Code Token Builder
Create custom ERC-20 tokens on Base instantly. Mintara's AI automatically audits smart contracts, detects vulnerabilities, and optimizes gas efficiency prior to deployment.

### 2. AI Audit & Optimization
The AI Audit Engine performs real-time code analysis, identifies security risks, and assigns a Smart Score before launch — ensuring maximum trust and compliance.

### 3. AI NFT Builder
**Now Live 🚀**

An integrated system enabling users to generate and mint AI-created NFTs, including AI-generated artwork, automatic metadata generation, on-chain minting with BaseScan verification, and batch minting with rarity configuration.

### 4. IVO Launchpad
The Intelligent Verified Offering (IVO) module provides a secure, AI-verified presale system with escrow protection. Investor funds remain locked until predefined audit conditions are met.

### 5. Distributed AI Verification
A network of distributed AI validators independently verifies contract safety and performance — ensuring a trustless and decentralized validation process.

**Ecosystem Flow:** → Token/NFT Creation → AI Audit → IVO Presale → Airdrop → Verification → Launch
