## Platform Overview

### 1. No-Code Token Builder

Create custom ERC-20 tokens on Base instantly.
Mintara's AI automatically audits smart contracts, detects vulnerabilities, and optimizes gas efficiency prior to deployment.

### 2. AI Audit & Optimization

The AI Audit Engine performs real-time code analysis, identifies security risks, and assigns a Smart Score before launch — ensuring maximum trust and compliance.

### 3. AI NFT Builder (Now Live 🚀)

An integrated system enabling users to generate and mint AI-created NFTs, including:

- AI-generated artwork
- Automatic metadata generation
- On-chain minting with BaseScan verification
- Batch minting and rarity configuration

### 4. IVO Launchpad

The Intelligent Verified Offering (IVO) module provides a secure, AI-verified presale system with escrow protection.
Investor funds remain locked until predefined audit conditions are met, ensuring full transparency and investor safety.

### 5. Distributed AI Verification

A network of distributed AI validators independently verifies contract safety and performance — ensuring a trustless and decentralized validation process.
